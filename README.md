# Smart Roads: Lighting the Way to Safety and Efficiency
### Abstract
The "Smart Roads: Lighting the Way to Safety and Efficiency" project introduces an innovative solution to improve the efficiency and sustainability of outdoor lighting systems. This research focuses on developing automated streetlights and introduces the indication concept for over-speeding drivers. The primary objectives of this design are to conserve energy, improve road traffic safety, and lower casualties from road traffic collisions. By harnessing LDR, Ultrasonic sensor, and Arduino board, the proposed streetlights can automatically detect ambient lighting conditions and respond accordingly. These smart streetlights are programmed to activate during nighttime (or overcast days) and remain off during daylight hours, thereby optimizing energy usage. An Ultrasonic sensor is introduced that detects any vehicle from a distance and activates the Streetlights as the vehicle approaches. Even so, using the data from the Ultrasonic sensor, the speed of vehicles is measured, and drivers are warned using additional lights at the mid-bottom of the lamp post. The significance of this project lies in its potential to revolutionize urban lighting infrastructure. The technology's accessibility and affordability can lead to a widespread adaptation, contributing to broader societal benefits.
